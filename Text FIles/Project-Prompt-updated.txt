## 📦 Core Functionalities

### 🔐 User Authentication
🔐 Authentication Approach
Simple Login/Logout System
Login:              POST /api/auth/login with username/password
Response:           Returns user details with role information
Frontend Storage:   Store user data in localStorage/sessionStorage
API Protection:     Each API call requires user credentials or user ID in headers
Logout:             Clear frontend storage, no server-side session management

- Role: `CUSTOMER` or `ENGINEER`
- Login via username/password
- Simple role-based access check, no Spring Security
