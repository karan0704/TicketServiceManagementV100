Comprehensive Ticket Management System Overview
This project delivers a robust and user-friendly Ticket Management System, meticulously designed to streamline the process of handling customer support inquiries and internal task assignments. It comprises a powerful backend API and an intuitive frontend interface, working in tandem to facilitate efficient management of tickets, user accounts (customers), and engineer accounts.

Project Purpose
The primary goal of this system is to provide a structured environment where customers can easily report issues, and a dedicated team of engineers can effectively manage, track, and resolve these issues. The system emphasizes clear role separation, ensuring that users only access functionalities relevant to their responsibilities.

Key Features
The system offers a range of functionalities tailored to different user roles:

User Authentication & Authorization:

Supports distinct user roles: CUSTOMER and ENGINEER.

A secure login mechanism authenticates users based on their credentials.

All subsequent actions are strictly controlled by role-based access, ensuring users can only perform authorized operations. For instance, creating engineer accounts or deleting tickets is restricted to engineers.

Ticket Management:

Customer Ticket Creation: Customers can easily create new tickets by providing a description of their issue. When a customer creates a ticket, the system automatically associates the ticket with the creating customer, and there is no dropdown menu for engineer assignment during this process.

Engineer Ticket Operations: Engineers have comprehensive control over tickets:

View all tickets.

Acknowledge newly CREATED tickets, assigning themselves to it.

Update existing tickets, including changing their description, status (e.g., to ACKNOWLEDGED, IN_PROGRESS, CLOSED), assigning or reassigning an engineer, adding customer comments, adding engineer comments, and setting a tentative resolution date.

Delete tickets.

User Account Management:

Customer Account Creation: New customer accounts can be created.

Engineer Account Creation: Only existing engineers (acting as administrators) are authorized to create new engineer accounts, reinforcing security and control over privileged roles.

Account Updates: Both customer and engineer accounts can be updated (e.g., username, password). Customers can update their own details.

Account Deletion: Engineer accounts can delete both customer and other engineer accounts.

Detailed Ticket Information:

Each ticket comprehensively stores:

A detailed description of the issue.

Its current status (e.g., CREATED, ACKNOWLEDGED, IN_PROGRESS, CLOSED).

The ticketCreateDate (timestamp of creation).

customerCommentOnTicket for customer-provided updates or additional info.

engineerCommentOnTicket for engineer notes and progress updates.

A tentativeResolutionDate to set expectations for issue resolution.

Clear associations with the Customer who created it and the Engineer assigned to it.

Technologies & Frameworks
The project is built using a modern full-stack architecture:

Backend (API Layer):

Language: Java

Framework: Spring Boot - Provides a rapid application development framework for creating stand-alone, production-ready Spring applications. It simplifies configuration and deployment.

Persistence (ORM): JPA (Java Persistence API) - The standard specification for object-relational mapping in Java.

JPA Provider: Hibernate - A powerful and widely used implementation of the JPA specification, responsible for mapping Java objects to database tables and executing SQL queries.

Database: MySQL - A popular open-source relational database management system used for storing all persistent application data.

Dependency Management: Maven (implicitly used for Spring Boot project structure).

Utility Library: Lombok - Reduces boilerplate code (getters, setters, constructors) through annotations.

Entity Models:

User (abstract @MappedSuperclass): Serves as a base class for common user attributes (id, username, password, role). It does not map to its own database table; its fields are inherited by its concrete entity subclasses.

Customer (concrete @Entity): Extends User, representing customer accounts. Mapped to a dedicated customers table, which includes all fields from User.

Engineer (concrete @Entity): Extends User, representing engineer accounts. Mapped to a dedicated engineers table, which also includes all fields from User.

Ticket (concrete @Entity): Represents individual support tickets. Mapped to a tickets table. It contains ticket-specific attributes and establishes @ManyToOne relationships with Customer (for the creator) and Engineer (for the assigned personnel).

Frontend (User Interface):

Core Technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - Standard web development languages for structuring content, styling, and adding interactivity.

Styling: Custom CSS is used to achieve a clean, modern, and responsive design. The 'Inter' font is utilized for improved readability.

Interaction: The frontend communicates with the backend via asynchronous RESTful API calls (using fetch API) to retrieve, create, update, and delete data. Custom JavaScript handles UI logic, form submissions, dynamic content loading, and user feedback (e.g., custom message boxes instead of alert()).

API Endpoints Implemented
The backend exposes a well-defined set of RESTful API endpoints for managing the system's resources:

1. TicketController (Resource: /tickets)
GET /tickets: Retrieves a list of all tickets.

GET /tickets/{id}: Retrieves a single ticket by ID.

POST /tickets: Creates a new ticket.

Role Restriction: Only CUSTOMER role can create.

Behavior: Automatically assigns createdBy based on X-Username header; no engineer dropdown for customers.

PUT /tickets/{id}: Updates an existing ticket (description, status, assigned engineer, comments, tentative resolution date).

DELETE /tickets/{id}: Deletes a ticket.

Role Restriction: Only ENGINEER role can delete.

PUT /tickets/{ticketId}/acknowledge/{engineerId}: Allows an engineer to acknowledge a CREATED ticket.

2. CustomerController (Resource: /customers)
GET /customers: Retrieves a list of all customer accounts.

POST /customers: Creates a new customer account.

Behavior: Sets role to CUSTOMER automatically.

PUT /customers/{id}: Updates a customer's details (username, password).

Role Restriction: role is enforced to remain CUSTOMER.

DELETE /customers/{id}: Deletes a customer account.

Role Restriction: Typically restricted to ENGINEER role.

3. EngineerController (Resource: /engineers)
GET /engineers: Retrieves a list of all engineer accounts.

GET /engineers/{id}: Retrieves a single engineer by ID.

POST /engineers: Creates a new engineer account.

Role Restriction: Only ENGINEER role can create.

Behavior: Sets role to ENGINEER automatically.

PUT /engineers/{id}: Updates an engineer's details (username, password).

DELETE /engineers/{id}: Deletes an engineer account.

Role Restriction: Typically restricted to ENGINEER role.

Suggestions for Future Enhancements
To further enhance the Ticket Management System, consider the following improvements:

Password Hashing: Implement strong password hashing (e.g., using Spring Security's BCryptPasswordEncoder) in the backend for all user accounts to improve security.

Robust Error Handling & Validation:

Implement more specific exception handling in the backend to return meaningful error messages to the frontend.

Add comprehensive input validation on both frontend (for user experience) and backend (for security and data integrity).

Frontend Routing: For a multi-page application, consider a client-side routing library (e.g., React Router if you transition to React) for cleaner URL management and single-page application feel.

Real-time Updates: Implement WebSocket communication (e.g., Spring WebSockets with STOMP) for real-time updates on ticket status, comments, or assignments, so users don't have to manually refresh.

Pagination & Filtering: For large lists of tickets, engineers, or customers, implement server-side pagination and filtering options to improve performance and usability.

Notifications: Add a notification system (e.g., email, in-app alerts) for status changes, new comments, or assignments.

File Attachments: Allow users to attach files (e.g., screenshots, logs) to tickets. This would require integrating with an object storage service (like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage) or a local file system.

Audit Logging: Implement comprehensive logging of all actions performed by users and engineers for auditing and debugging purposes.

User Interface Refinements:

Implement more dynamic forms (e.g., showing/hiding fields based on status or role).

Add visual cues for loading states (e.g., spiners).

Improve date/time pickers for tentativeResolutionDate.

Admin Dashboard: Create a dedicated dashboard for administrators with analytics, user activity logs, and system configuration options.

These suggestions aim to improve the system's security, scalability, user experience, and overall functionality.

for this project i want to create entity class
so just write should i do how could i do this and what things should i look 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


A Ticket is created by one Customer (many tickets to one customer).
A Ticket is assigned to one Engineer (optional at first, many tickets to one engineer).
how can i Define Relationships by which annotaion
